There is a frontend folder that contains all code connected with Frontend.
Structure of frontend directory:
  mockups - contains all current mockups,
  css - styles for mockups,
  js - files with some basic angular logic.
  
Every file has a prefix like "anton-"  that points to the author of this file. That naming-style will last only through starting stage of development.
Titles of the files display their logical using whether it's "main-page-module.js" for angular-modules of the main page or "main-page-styles.css" for css styles of main page.
